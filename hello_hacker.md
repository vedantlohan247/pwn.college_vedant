# Command Hisotry
The challenge asks us to use up and down keys to acess the previous commands.


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EbHDFwJa6_l_gG1tq3sNFE0YL6I.0lNzEzNxwSM3kjNzEzW}`

By using the up key on the keyboard I was able to get the flag, which was present in one of the previous commands.


## What I learned
I learned that shell store the history of all of your previously used commands and you can access them using the up or down keys. This saves time for you because you don't have to type in the same command again and again.
